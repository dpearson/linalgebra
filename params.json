Otherwise, see the [function reference](https://github.com/dpearson/linalgebra/blob/master/docs/functions.md)\r\n\r\n### License ###\r\n\r\n\tCopyright (c) 2013, David Pearson\r\n\tAll rights reserved.\r\n\t\r\n\tRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n\tRedistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\n\tRedistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\n\tTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
