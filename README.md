## Linear Algebra Library for Node.js ##

This is a library for elementary linear algebra in node.js.

At this point, I am working on this library solely for my own benefit in learning the underlying mathematical concepts; features are being added as I learn more.

### Setting Up ###

Make sure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:

    sudo npm install -g coffee-script
    npm install
    cake build

### Documentation ###

Matrices are represented as standard two-dimension arrays, even for those with only a single row. Otherwise, see the [function reference](https://github.com/dpearson/linalgebra/blob/master/docs/functions.md)
