          <h2>Linear Algebra Library for Node.js</h2>

<p>This is a library for elementary linear algebra in node.js.</p>

<p>At this point, I am working on this library solely for my own benefit in learning the underlying mathematical concepts; features are being added as I learn more.</p>

<h3>Setting Up</h3>

<p>Make sure you have <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> installed, then run:</p>

<pre><code>sudo npm install -g coffee-script
npm install
cake build
</code></pre>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>Matrices are represented as standard two-dimension arrays, even for those with only a single row. Otherwise, see the <a href="https://github.com/dpearson/linalgebra/blob/master/docs/functions.md">function reference</a></p>
